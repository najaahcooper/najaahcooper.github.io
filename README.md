## Marketing Philosophy

I believe the strongest marketing work happens when:
- Brand and performance are treated as complementary, not competing
- Data informs decisions without diluting creativity
- Campaigns are designed around real audience behavior
- Measurement is tied to learning, not just reporting

I’m particularly drawn to teams that value **clarity, collaboration, and thoughtful execution**.
